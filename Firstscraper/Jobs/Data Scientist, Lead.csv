o9 Solutions is looking for an experienced, talented, and motivated Lead Data Scientist to come join our global team. As part of this Data Science team, you will be involved in the end-to-end delivery of our supply chain planning products and building advanced forecasting models with Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning and AI with algorithms such as R, and Python. These models will have used cases for Demand Planning, Supply Planning, Market Mix Modeling, Price Elasticity, New Product Planning, Store Assortment, Market Optimization, and more.
You will be key in understanding the customers supply chain problems, designing solutions, developing, and deploying models, validating, and maintaining those models.
A successful candidate will bring a Master’s in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, and 5+ years of experience in hands-on modeling in R or Python, in a supply chain forecasting capacity. You will enjoy working directly with customers and our larger o9 Data Science team.
What you’ll do for us:
Research, design, build, deploy, and validate new and existing machine learning models and predictive analytics for advanced forecasting in supply chain demand planning that will drive our customers growth from insights that are allow for better decision making
Apply a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, regression, neural nets, time series, optimizations etc.) to their real-world advantages/drawbacks for insights internally and externally
Collaborate with solution architects, business operations specialists, engineers, data scientists, product managers, and internal/external business teams to make sure the models are aligned with business objectives and customer needs
Develop machine learning models for segmentation and optimization
