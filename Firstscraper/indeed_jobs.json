    "qualifications": "We’re an applied science group leaning towards modern Deep Learning. We expect our Senior Machine Learning Scientists to have a well-balanced set of skills, both in the Science as well as Software Engineering aspects of (Deep) Machine Learning. You will focus on developing novel and deployable ML models and solutions where no ready-made solution may be available. Therefore you need to be conversant enough with the mathematics of machine learning and deep neural networks such that you can construct novel model architectures, loss functions, training methods, training loops etc. You are also expected to keep abreast of the latest research advancements in AI and Deep Learning across modalities and apply those to your work. While we leverage ready-made training platforms, we also write our own training loops. Additionally, the models need to be directly deployable in our products, therefore, production level coding and software engineering proficiency is required. You may train large models (up to 100s of billions of parameters) therefore, ability to train on multiple GPUs and nodes and knowledge of the latest model training and inferencing advancements is necessary. Next, the models must perform well in production not only in terms of accuracy but also compute-cost. Delivering such software requires a sufficiently deep Computer Science background. Dataset exploration, generation (synthetic), design, construction and analysis, are a routine part of the job and may occupy a significant fraction of your time. Also, datasets can be large (billions of samples), therefore the ability to write parallel and efficient pipelines is a necessary skill. You will also be involved in code & model maintenance, code hardening (preparing the model and code for production pipelines), developing and staging demos and presenting your work within the company as well as via publications in peer reviewed venues (preferably A/A+ rated).; Day-to-day, your responsibilities are to:; Research and develop production grade Machine Learning models as described above.
